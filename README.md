Scenario 1 – Multilinear Regression:
This scenario focuses on predicting student academic performance using multiple academic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. The final exam score is computed as the average of math, reading, and writing scores from the Student Performance in Exams dataset available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams
. Multilinear regression is applied after data preprocessing, feature encoding, scaling, and model evaluation using standard regression metrics.

Scenario 2 – Polynomial Regression:
This scenario involves predicting vehicle fuel efficiency (MPG) based on engine horsepower, where the relationship between variables is non-linear. The Auto MPG dataset is sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/autompg-dataset
. Polynomial regression models of varying degrees are trained and evaluated to analyze underfitting, overfitting, and the impact of regularization techniques such as Ridge regression.
